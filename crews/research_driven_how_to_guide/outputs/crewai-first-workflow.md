2. Type: `pip3 install crewai`

**For Linux users:**
- Use your package manager or pip install crewai

## Step 2: Creating Your First Crew

### Understanding the CrewAI Approach

Instead of one AI trying to do everything, CrewAI uses specialized agents working together like a real team:
- **Researcher**: Finds and gathers information
- **Analyst**: Analyzes and organizes the findings
- **Writer**: Creates the final report

This mirrors how real teams work, making the process more reliable and the output higher quality.

### Creating Your First Crew

**Step 1: Create the Researcher agent**
- This agent will search the web for your chosen topic

**Step 2: Create the Analyst agent**
- This agent will identify key points from the research

**Step 3: Create the Writer agent**
- This agent will create a polished report

## Step 3: Running Your First Crew

**Step 1: Start the research process**
- The Researcher agent will search the web for your chosen topic
- You'll see live updates as it finds sources

**Step 2: Analyze the findings**
- The Analyst agent will identify key points from the research

**Step 3: Create the final report**
- The Writer agent will create a polished report

## Common Issues and Solutions

**Problem: Installation fails**
- Solution: Ensure you're using Python 3.8+ and try: `pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel` then retry

**Problem: API key issues**
- Solution: Create a .env file with your API keys in the correct format

**Problem: Agents not responding**
- Solution: Check internet connection and verify API keys are active

## Pro Tips for Success
- Start with this simple 3-agent crew before trying complex workflows
- Always test each agent individually before connecting them
- Save your work frequently as CrewAI can be resource-intensive
- Use the playground to test prompts before running the full workflow
